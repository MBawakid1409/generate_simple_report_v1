## Description of this script:
### This script to track user login and logout events on different machines and generate a report of currently logged-in users for each machine.


## Note: I didn't create this code froms scratch, and the purpose is to undersand and get better idea how to develop more complex scripts like this one in near.

## The source code of this code is from Coursera > Google IT Automation with Python Track > Course 1 of 6 > Module 5 "Final Project".


## My outcomes after this project:
### - Better understanding of using many functions at the same time for example > using get_event_date with sort method gives us a new list using it inside current_user function..
### - How object instance delegated for example > 'event' which is index from 'events' object of 'Event' class..
